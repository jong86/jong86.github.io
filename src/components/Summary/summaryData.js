I've dabbled with making web pages since I was in high school, and I've recently decided on a career switch into what I have more passion for. I'm also an alumni of the Lighthouse Labs Web Dev Bootcamp in Vancouver.\n\nOther than coding, in my spare time I enjoy playing guitar and producing music.`
